# DifferentialCalculus

This projects has been build during graduate class 780 Numerical Methods. They execute hard math calculations and solve complex calculus equations. 

ProgramExample1: Taken as input a tri-diagonal linear systems, use the tri-diagonal equations system to solve the equantions and find the x-dim points where y equals to zero (approximate to the 4th decimal point).

ProgramExample2: Taken as input a function and a limited interval, use bisection method to find the roots of the equation to up to 4 decimal points of accurancy.

ProgramExample3:  Taken as input a function and a limited interval, use mid point method to find the roots of the equationto up to 4 decimal points of accurancy.

ProgramExample4: Taken as input a differential equation, use Runge Kutta method (RK4) to integrate the equation.
